# dungeon crawler

  
UW Washington Graduate Certificate in SDE project  
  
ASCII-art based dungeon game with randomly generating maze  
  
Collect 4 pillars (of object-oriented programming) to escape the dungeon  
while surving through pits, using health and vision potions  
  
Project developed using object-oriented programming with complete class documentation.  
Maze generation uses self-validating algorithms to ensure  
pillars are obtainable and game can be won while placing at least 1 room  
that cannot be entered, adding complexity to the maze generation.  
  
PyGame is used to add music and sound features  
  
Menus for restarting game, change sound volume, and to use potions  
  
To reveal secret map in-game, enter the pause-menu then enter 5.

This assignment satisfies all 10 course objectives! 
    C1: Use fundamental concepts of object-oriented design to write modular, extensible code
    C2: Use common design patterns to increase testability, readability, and maintainability of code
    C3: Apply skills to systematically test and debug applications
    C4: Recognize code smells and refactor code accordingly
    C5: Use data structures and algorithms from TCSS 501 in programming applications
    C6: Use the space time/characteristics of different search and sorting algorithms learned in TCSS 501
        to choose the appropriate methods to implement.
    C7: Design, implement, document and debug a medium complexity program with an object hierarchy that
        includes interfaces and/or abstract classes and a graphical user interface, given some guidance 
        on the design.
    C8: Design and implement unit tests for a medium complexity program with an object hierarchy that
        includes interfaces and/or abstract classes.
    C9: Utilize modern software engineering tools (e.g., IDEs, static checkers, unit testing frameworks,
        revision control systems) during the implementation of a medium complexity program.
    C10: Correctly employ programming language features by reading and interpreting the associated published
        API documentation.
